# Tiktok Like App
This project is a TikTok-like mobile application built using JavaScript, Expo, and React Native. The main focus of this project was to study the usage of the Video tag in React Native to create a video playback functionality.

## Features
 - Video List: The application displays a list of mocked videos that can be scrolled vertically.
 - Video Playback: Users can play, pause, and navigate through the videos in the list.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following software installed:

 - Node.js: Install Node.js from the official website.
 - Expo CLI: Install Expo CLI globally by running the following command:
```shell
npm install -g expo-cli
```

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the application:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tiktok-like-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd tiktok-like-app
```

3. Install dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```

4. Start the Expo development server:
```shell
expo start
```

5. Use your preferred method (Expo Go app, iOS Simulator, Android Emulator) to run the application.

## Configuration
The project utilizes the Video tag in React Native to handle video playback. The configuration is already set up, but you can modify it if needed.

 - App.js: The main entry point of the application. It contains the Feed screen.
 - utils/videos/: Place your video files in this directory to include them in the video list.
 - Feed/index.jsx: the feed page with all functions
